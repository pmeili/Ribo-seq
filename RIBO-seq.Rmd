# Genome-Wide Analysis in Vivo of Translation with Nucleotide Resolution Using Ribosome Profiling

## Statistics

- A ribosome-profiling strategy based on deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments and enables genome-wide investigation of translation with subcodon resolution. 

- Used tp monitor translation in budding yeast under both rich and starvation conditions. 

- ?
